\description{
Metadata tables describing the fixed-width file layout for US mortality
multiple cause datasets from the CDC NCHS. Each object covers one data year
and contains the column positions, types, and code mappings needed to parse
the corresponding fixed-width file.
}
\note{
This is an early year with limited coding — several fields left blank.

This year introduced a revised race classification schema.

Additional cause of death fields were added to the layout this year.

Geographic identifiers are present: positions 21–60 contain state,
county, and city of both occurrence and residence, PMSA/MSA, CMSA, and
place of birth. This detail was removed from public-use files from 2005
onward per NCHS data access policy.

Both 1989 and 2003 education revision fields are present alongside an
\code{education_reporting_flag} indicating which revision was used.

\code{record_type} is present at position 19. \code{marital_status}
includes code \code{N} (not on certificate). Occupation and industry fields
are absent.

Layout is structurally identical to 2003, retaining full geographic
detail in positions 21–60 and dual education revision fields.

\code{record_type} is present at position 19. \code{marital_status}
includes code \code{N} (not on certificate). Occupation and industry fields
are absent.

Geographic identifiers were removed from the public-use file this year
per a new NCHS data access policy. Positions 1–19 and 21–60 are reserved
(blank). The \code{record_type} field is absent from 2005 onward.

\code{marital_status} code \code{N} (not on certificate) is removed.
Both 1989 and 2003 education revision fields are retained. Occupation and
industry fields are absent.

Layout is structurally identical to 2005. Geographic identifiers remain
excluded per NCHS data access policy.

Both education revision fields are present. Occupation and industry
fields are absent.

Layout is structurally identical to 2005–2006. Geographic identifiers
remain excluded per NCHS data access policy.
