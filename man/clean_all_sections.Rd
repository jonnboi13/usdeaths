\title{Clean and Reshape All CDC Vital Statistics Sections}
\usage{
clean_all_sections(datas, url_pdf)
}
\arguments{
\item{datas}{A named list of raw tibbles as returned by
\code{\link{scrape_all_sections}}.}

\item{url_pdf}{URL to the CDC mortality public use data page, used to scrape
mortality user guide links separately.}
}
\value{
The same named list with each element cleaned and pivoted to wide
format, with one row per year and columns for each subsection's URL,
file size, and file type.
}
\description{
Applies section-specific cleaning and reshaping to each element of the raw
scraped data list. Each section has unique quirks that require custom handling
before the data can be combined into a lookup table.
}
\details{
Section-specific handling:
\describe{
\item{Births}{Addenda filtered out; user guide URL forward-filled for
years without a dedicated guide.}
\item{Period Linked}{Rows with no U.S. Data URL are dropped.}
\item{Matched Multiple}{Redundant 1995-1997 file dropped in favour of
the superseding 1995-2000 file.}
\item{Mortality Multiple}{User guides are hosted on a separate page and
scraped independently. 1997 and 1998 require a further dedicated scrape
to extract the Detail Record Layout PDF. User guide URL is
forward-filled for years without a dedicated guide.}
\item{Fetal Death}{For 2014 and 2015, the plain U.S. Data and U.S.
Territories files are dropped in favour of the richer
"with cause of death" versions.}
